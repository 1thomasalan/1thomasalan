- 👋 Hi, I’m @1thomasalan Thomas Alan and I live in Japan.
- 👀 I’m a photographer and digital marketing manager who used to be a web developer from 1999-2010, moved to Japan, and changed careers. Now, I'm looking to pivot back into web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in a Web Design and Development certificate program at Cornell as a way to give me structure while I re-learn old skills and learn new ones.
- 💞️ I’m anxious to learn and get back up to speed, and when I'm ready, excited to collaborate on projects with others.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm available on Twitter @tasmilie

Cheers, TA
