- 👋 Hi, I’m @1thomasalan Thomas Alan and I live in Japan.
- 👀 I’m a photographer and digital marketing manager who used to be a web developer from 1999-2010, moved to Japan, and changed careers. Now, I'm looking to pivot back into web development.
- 💞️ I’m anxious to learn and get back up to speed, and when I'm ready, excited to collaborate on projects with others.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm available on Twitter @tasmilie
- I also publish a weekly newsletter called Big in Japan where I share cool stuff about Japan if you're into that. big-in-japan.com or Google Big in Japan Newsletter.

Cheers, TA
